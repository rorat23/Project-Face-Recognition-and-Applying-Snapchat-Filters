# Project-Face-Recognition-and-Applying-Snapchat-Filters
•	Training data is captured using OpenCV & stored in data folder as numpy array('Name.npy').  
•	Using Haarcascades as cascade classifier for face and nose detection.  
•	KNN algorithm is used for face classification.   
•	After face recognition snapchat filter(moustache) is applied using the alpha values.
